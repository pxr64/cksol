/// Maximum size in bytes of a [`Memo`] when serialized into an [ICRC-1 memo].
///
/// The largest memo is a [`MintMemo::Sweep`], which encodes to 81 bytes:
///
/// | Bytes | Content |
/// | --- | --- |
/// | 2 | the [`Memo`] enum, as an array holding the index of [`Memo::Mint`] |
/// | 1 | the array holding the single field of [`Memo::Mint`] |
/// | 2 | the [`MintMemo`] enum, as an array holding the index of [`MintMemo::Sweep`] |
/// | 1 | the array holding the two fields of [`MintMemo::Sweep`] |
/// | 2 | the byte string header of the signature, whose length needs a byte of its own |
/// | 64 | the sweep signature |
/// | 9 | the deposit id, as an unsigned integer |
///
/// Only the deposit id varies, since CBOR encodes an integer in as few bytes as
/// possible: it takes nine bytes above [`u32::MAX`] and at most five below, which
/// keeps the memo within 80 bytes for every deposit id reachable in practice.
///
/// A ledger whose `max_memo_length` is below this value rejects the mints whose memo
/// exceeds its limit, and one below the size of the smallest memo, such as the ICRC-1
/// default of 32 bytes, rejects all of them.
///
/// SPL withdrawal memos use top-level variants without the nested [`BurnMemo`]
/// wrapper. [`Memo::SplWithdrawalFee`] is at most 80 bytes, and
/// [`Memo::SplConvert`] is at most 46 bytes, including a full [`u64::MAX`] token
/// amount or fee-burn index. Existing mint and SOL burn encodings are unchanged.
///
